        <a name="Blood">Blood Tests</a></h2>
    <font>A blood test is a laboratory analysis performed on a blood sample that is usually
        extracted from a vein in the arm using a needle, or via fingerprick. Multiple tests
        for specific blood components (such as a glucose test or a cholesterol test) are
        often grouped together into one test panel called a blood panel or blood work. Blood
        tests[1] are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical
        states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and
        organ function. Typical clinical blood panels include a basic metabolic panel or
        a complete blood count. Blood tests are also used in drug tests to detect drug abuse.

        <a name="Lipid">Lipid Profile</a></h2>
    <font>Lipid profile or lipid panel, is a panel of blood tests that serves as an initial
        broad medical screening tool for abnormalities in lipids, such as cholesterol and
        triglycerides. The results of this test can identify certain genetic diseases and
        can determine approximate risks for cardiovascular disease, certain forms of pancreatitis,
        and other diseases. Lipid panels are commonly ordered as part of a physical exam,
        along with other panels such as the complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic
        panel (BMP). </font>
    <h2>
        <a name="Urine">Urine Tests</a></h2>
    <font>Doctors order urine tests for kids to make sure that the kidneys and certain other
        organs are working as they should, or when they think that a child might have an
        infection in the kidneys, bladder, or other parts of the urinary tract. The kidneys
        make urine (pee) as they filter wastes from the bloodstream, while leaving substances
        in the blood that the body needs, like protein and glucose. So when urine contains
        glucose, too much protein, or has other irregularities, it's usually a sign of a
        health problem.
        <br />
        Urinalysis:
        <br />
        A urinalysis is usually ordered when a doctor suspects that a child has a urinary
        tract infection (UTI) or a health problem that can cause an abnormality in the urine.
        This test can measure: the number and variety of red and white blood cells the presence
        of bacteria or other organisms the presence of substances, such as glucose, that
        usually shouldn't be found in the urine the pH, which shows how acidic or basic
        the urine is the concentration of the urine Sometimes, when the urine contains white
        blood cells or protein, or the test results seem abnormal for another reason, it's
        because of how or when the urine was collected. For example, a dehydrated child
        may have concentrated (darker) urine or a small amount of protein in the urine.
        But that might not mean that there's a health problem. Once the child is rehydrated,
        these "abnormal" results may disappear. Depending on the amount of protein or other
        cells in the urine, the doctor may repeat the urine test at another time, just to
        make sure that everything is back to normal. </font>
